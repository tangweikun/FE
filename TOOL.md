## Why do you want to work here

Kong api / code
The reason why most interviewers ask this question is because they want to know how enthusiastic and knowledgeable you are about the company and the role you applied for. What you should do in response to this interview question is to give specific examples of things that piqued your interest about the company and/or the job description in the first place. Next, elaborate on your strengths, achievements and skills, then link them back to the job you are applying for. If the company has an expansive presence online, one easy way to learn more is to go through past news releases to find out the various projects and initiatives that the company is involved with. These nuggets of information are ammunition that you can use to ace this question.

## What are your strengths

What the interviewer is really asking is what tasks you are particularly good at and how you as a new hire will fit into the role. What you can do is to pick a few key strengths that are relevant to the role, then give past examples to support those examples. These strengths could include everything from leadership and teamwork to your ability to work on tight deadlines or multitasking. Go easy with your answer, though, because going off on a question like that risks coming across as being too boastful — not a quality that interviewers necessarily gravitate to.

When talking about your strengths, one easy way to avoid coming across as being too boastful is to give a past example of how you were faced with a difficult situation and the skills you engaged to handle the problem. Stick to the facts and you will naturally be able to display your strengths without being overly confident about it.

## What are your weaknesses

And with strengths come weaknesses, the one-two punch of interview questions. What the interviewer wants to know with this question is just how self-aware you are at the workplace. Instead of using the word ‘weakness’, however, try using ‘areas for improvement’ instead. For example, if there is a particular skill set that you lack, you can go ahead and mention it but make sure to outline the steps that you are taking to overcome said shortcoming. The idea here is to be honest about where you fall short, but also show that you are proactively trying to fill those skill gaps. Lastly, never say that you don’t have any weaknesses. It comes across as disingenuous at best or, at worse, a bald faced lie.

## What have been your achievements

You know this question is bound to come up, so keep two or three key achievements in your backpocket, complete with a number of facts and figures to back them up. On top of that, give a summary of what the situation or problem was, the actions you took under those circumstances, as well as the skills you utilised to achieve the positive outcome. Another tip is to have a short list of these accomplishments at hand at all times, so you can rotate them based on who you are talking to or the job you are applying for.

## What did you like or dislike about your last job

Asking you this question is the interviewer’s attempt to find out your key interests and whether the job on offer has tasks or responsibilities that you will like or dislike. For the positive aspects of your last position, things are pretty straightforward. Focus on the parts that you enjoyed the most, explain what you learnt from them, then go on to talk about how it made you develop as an individual.

On the flipside, you left your last job for a reason — sometimes a variety of reasons — but the key is not to take this opportunity to air your grievances. Be mindful about criticising your employer. Unless your former boss was truly a toxic individual, complaining about him or her can come across sometimes as you pushing the blame on others. Choose examples that do not reflect on your skills, such as the size of the company or the team you were working with, or which reveals a positive trait (such as your distaste for long decision-making process and bureaucratic tapes). The trick, at the end of the day, is to turn even the negatives, such as a toxic boss, into a positive.

## What are your future goals

Variations of this question could include “Where do you see yourself in the next five years?” or “How do you see yourself developing in this company?” No matter the delivery of the question, the purpose is the same: to probe your ambition and the extent of your career planning. In response, describe how your goal is to continue to grow, learn, add value and take on new responsibilities in the future that build on the role for which you are applying. Avoid replies like “I see myself being part of the company” because that’s the whole reason why you are having a job interview in the first place.

Of course, that is not to say that interviewers will only ask you a standard set of questions. In fact, there is a whole host of unusual interview questions or behavioural questions that they can ask. However, once you have your bases covered in terms of common interview questions, your foundation is set for tougher, more complex interview challenges ahead.

## Do you have any questions for me

Being asked by if you have any questions for the interviewer does not mean that the interview is over. In fact, this seemingly harmless rhetorical question is actually one of the most common interview questions out there — and saying ‘No’ is actually one of the worst answers you can give.

Think about it this way: a job interview is like a two-way street. Instead of the interviewer asking your typical interview questions, this is your opportunity to know more about the company, the role that you are applying for, as well as how you fit into the grander scheme of things. After all, asking the right questions is what separates exceptional job seekers from the average.
